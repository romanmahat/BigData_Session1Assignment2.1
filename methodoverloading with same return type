question number 8:Can we overload a method with same return type?Explain your answer with proper logic?

You can't do it in Java. 
The rationale is that the return value alone is not sufficient for the compiler to figure out which function to call.


program:
import java.io.*;
 
class Addition
{
    
    public int add(int a, int b)
    {
         
        int sum = a+b;
        return sum;
    }
     
    
    public double add(int a, int b)
    {
        double sum = a+b+0.0;
        return sum;
    }
   
}
 
class GFG 
{
    public static void main (String[] args) 
    {
        Addition ob = new Addition();
         
        int sum1 = ob.add(1,2);
        System.out.println("sum of the two integer value :" + sum1);
         
        int sum2 = ob.add(1,2);
        System.out.println("sum of the three integer value :" + sum2);
         
    }
}

output of this program is error.
